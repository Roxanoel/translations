# Translations
The purpose of this repository is to publish in a centralized way all of the Latin to English translations I have been working on. The focus of this repo will be on twelfth-century philosophical works. In the spirit of open source software, I want to make these translations freely available, and allow contributors to propose amendments and corrections, either through pull requests or through suggestions sent as an email. Do feel free to get in touch if you want to contribute to this project!
