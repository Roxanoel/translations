But those from which a logical definition is composed are\nonly <em>genera</em> and <em>differentiae</em>; therefore <em>genera</em> and <em>differentiae</em>\n are names and verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Against this. In the book On the Soul, it is said that a universal either is nothing, or is posterior. In the sixth <span>book</span> of the Topics, it is said that <span><em>genus</em> and <em>differentia</em> are defined by a prior nature/ are by nature prior to species.</span></p></div></root>\n</div></body></html>"))
