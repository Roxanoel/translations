But those from which a logical definition is composed are\nonly <em class=\"original-latin\">genera</em> and <em class=\"original-latin\">differentiae</em>; therefore <em class=\"original-latin\">genera</em> and <em class=\"original-latin\">differentiae</em>\n are names and verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Against this. In the book On the Soul, it is said that a universal either is nothing, or is posterior. In the sixth <span class=\"addition\">book</span> of the Topics, it is said that <span class=\"uncertain\"><em class=\"original-latin\">genus</em> and <em class=\"original-latin\">differentia</em> are defined by a prior nature/ are by nature prior to species.</span></p>\n\n<p>For the second <span class=\"addition\">position</span>. Every form is made one in number from a subject one in number in which it is; but every thing existing in the soul or in some particular is in a subject one in number; therefore every thing existing in a particular and in the soul is one in number; therefore, whether a universal is posited in the soul or outside, it will not exist in a particular, unless it is one in number.</p>\n\n<p>Against this. <span class=\"uncertain\">Augustine</span> says, in his Metaphysics, that a form <span class=\"addition\">which is</span> one in number cannot be in different subjects. In the third <span class=\"addition\">book</span> of the Physics it is said that motion, since it is one and indivisible, is in the agent and in the patient.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the third <span class=\"addition\">position</span>, the reason is as follows: in the book On Generation, growth is described in this way, that growth is <span class=\"uncertain\">the addition of preexisting sizes (<em class=\"original-latin\">praeexistentis magnitudinis</em>); but in no way composed of preexisting sizes, etc.; therefore, nothing grows in such a way. Proof of the middle by the division of ages in adolescence, youth, maturity and old age. For, in adolescence, by nature, <span class=\"addition\">one</span> receives more food than <span class=\"addition\">what</span> is excreted, in youth, the same amount, in maturity and old age, less; for this reason, something is never added to preexisting size; therefore no composed thing grows.</span></p>\n\n<p>Against this. In the book on Generation, it is said that change (<em class=\"original-latin\">alteratio</em>) precedes generation, but in the eighth <span class=\"addition\">book</span> of the Physics it is said that generation <span class=\"addition\">is</span> change.</p>\n\n<p>For the fourth, the reason is thus: If <span class=\"addition\">something</span> is moved, either it moves in time or in an instant; but there is no movement in time, because nothing happens to receive existence <em class=\"original-latin\">actualiter</em> in time except now; likewise, now (<em class=\"original-latin\">in nunc</em>) <span class=\"uncertain\">it does not happen to be moved/ movement does not happen</span>, this is proved in the sixth <span class=\"addition\">book <span class=\"uncertain\">of the Physics</span></span>; therefore, simply nothing happens to be moved.</p>\n\n<p>Against this. In <span class=\"addition\">book</span> seven of the Physics, he <span class=\"addition\">(Aristotle)</span> says that nothing is moved by itself. In <span class=\"addition\">book</span> eight, he says that many are moved by themselves, including animals. </p>\n\n<p>[End of the manuscript]</p></div></root>\n</div></body></html>"))
