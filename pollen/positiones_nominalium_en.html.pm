These are our positions concerning universals.
◊items-numbered{
◊item{First, we ◊uncertain{consent} that universals, like ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{species}, are names (◊original-latin{nomina}).}
◊item{Second, we posit, against the opinion of the ◊original-latin{reales}, that nothing exists aside from particulars.}
◊item{Third, we disagree with what is proposed by Aristotle in the book on Generation, ◊addition{namely} that ◊uncertain{something can grow (◊original-latin{augmentari})}}
◊item{Fourth, we say, with Zeno, that it does not appear that something ◊addition{can} move, to which Aristotle disagrees at the end of the sixth ◊addition{book} of Physics.}
◊item{We state that there is no action, except via pores (◊original-latin{per poros}).}
◊item{Again, we say, with Zeno, that being is said univocally about those ◊addition{things} which are (◊original-latin{de hiis quae sunt}).}
◊item{Moreover, we say that there are only two universals, namely ◊original-latin{genus} and ◊original-latin{species};}
◊item{and that some accident is in a subject which neither denominates the subject ◊original-latin{simpliciter}, nor according to the "what" (◊original-latin{secundum quid});}
◊item{and that ◊uncertain{"accident"} contains under itself all universals.}
◊item{Again, we say that grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric are a single science (◊original-latin{unam scientiam}), against the division of Al-Farabi;}
◊item{besides this we disagree with what Priscian ◊folio{88rB} is saying, ◊addition{namely} that a syllab cannot ◊uncertain{be had in a meter at many times (◊original-latin{plura tempora}), because we posit that a syllab can be had in an infinite time.}}
◊item{Also we disagree with the same ◊addition{(Priscian)} and agree with the Stoics, who posited that an interjection has to be included among adverbs.}
◊item{Again, we posit that it is insufficient, because he did not teach the species of figures of speech (◊original-latin{topoi}).}
◊item{Likewise, we posit that no construction is faulty.}
◊item{Similarly, against Aristotle, we say that the book On Interpretation is thoroughly ◊uncertain{superfluous/overabundant}.}
◊item{And again that it is ◊uncertain{diminished}, because it did not thoroughly teach the art of dividing,}
◊item{and that all science is demonstrative, not topical ◊addition{(of the topics)}.}

◊p{For the first ◊addition{position}, the reason (◊original-latin{ratio}) is this: Every definitive phrase
(◊original-latin{oratio}) is composed from names and verbs (which is manifest by induction); but a definition
is an ◊original-latin{oratio} indicating what a being is (◊original-latin{quid est esse}); therefore an ◊original-latin{oratio}
 indicating what a being is is composed of names and verbs. But those from which a logical definition is composed are
only ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{differentiae}; therefore ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{differentiae}
 are names and verbs.}

◊p{Against this. In the book On the Soul, it is said that a universal either is nothing, or is posterior. In the sixth ◊addition{book} of the Topics, it is said that ◊uncertain{◊original-latin{genus} and ◊original-latin{differentia} are defined by a prior nature/ are by nature prior to species.}}

◊p{For the second ◊addition{position}. Every form is made one in number from a subject one in number in which it is; but every thing existing in the soul or in some particular is in a subject one in number; therefore every thing existing in a particular and in the soul is one in number; therefore, whether a universal is posited in the soul or outside, it will not exist in a particular, unless it is one in number.}

◊p{Against this. ◊uncertain{Augustine} says, in his Metaphysics, that a form ◊addition{which is} one in number cannot be in different subjects. In the third ◊addition{book} of the Physics it is said that motion, since it is one and indivisible, is in the agent and in the patient.}

◊p{Towards the third ◊addition{position}, the reason is as follows: in the book On Generation, growth is described in this way, that growth is ◊uncertain{the addition of preexisting sizes (◊original-latin{praeexistentis magnitudinis}); but in no way composed of preexisting sizes, etc.; therefore, nothing grows in such a way. Proof of the middle by the division of ages in adolescence, youth, maturity and old age. For, in adolescence, by nature, ◊addition{one} receives more food than ◊addition{what} is excreted, in youth, the same amount, in maturity and old age, less; for this reason, something is never added to preexisting size; therefore no composed thing grows.}}

◊p{Against this. In the book on Generation, it is said that change (◊original-latin{alteratio}) precedes generation, but in the eighth ◊addition{book} of the Physics it is said that generation ◊addition{is} change.}
