These are our positions concerning universals.
◊items-numbered{
◊item{First, we ◊uncertain{consent} that universals, like ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{species}, are names (◊original-latin{nomina}).}
◊item{Second, we posit, against the opinion of the ◊original-latin{reales}, that nothing exists aside from particulars.}
◊item{Third, we disagree with what is proposed by Aristotle in the book on Generation, ◊addition{namely} that ◊uncertain{something can grow (◊original-latin{augmentari})}}
◊item{Fourth, we say, with Zeno, that it does not appear that something ◊addition{can} move, to which Aristotle disagrees at the end of the sixth ◊addition{book} of Physics.}
◊item{We state that there is no action, except via pores (◊original-latin{per poros}).}
◊item{Again, we say, with Zeno, that being is said univocally about those ◊addition{things} which are (◊original-latin{de hiis quae sunt}).}
◊item{Moreover, we say that there are only two universals, namely ◊original-latin{genus} and ◊original-latin{species};}
◊item{and that some accident is in a subject which neither denominates the subject ◊original-latin{simpliciter}, nor according to the "what" (◊original-latin{secundum quid});}
◊item{and that ◊uncertain{"accident"} contains under itself all universals.}
◊item{Again, we say that grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric are a single science (◊original-latin{unam scientiam}), against the division of Al-Farabi;}
◊item{besides this we disagree with what Priscian ◊folio{88rB} is saying, ◊addition{namely} that a syllab cannot ◊uncertain{be had in a meter at many times (◊original-latin{plura tempora}), because we posit that a syllab can be had in an infinite time.}}
◊item{Also we disagree with the same ◊addition{(Priscian)} and agree with the Stoics, who posited that an interjection has to be included among adverbs.}
◊item{Again, we posit that it is insufficient, because he did not teach the species of figures of speech (◊original-latin{topoi}).}
◊item{Likewise, we posit that no construction is faulty.}
◊item{Similarly, against Aristotle, we say that the book On Interpretation is thoroughly ◊uncertain{superfluous/overabundant}.}
◊item{And again that it is ◊uncertain{diminished}, because it did not thoroughly teach the art of dividing,}
◊item{and that all science is demonstrative, not topical ◊addition{(of the topics)}.}
}
◊p{For the first ◊addition{position}, the reason (◊original-latin{ratio}) is this: Every definitive phrase (◊original-latin{oratio}) is composed from names and verbs (which is manifest by induction); but a definition is an ◊original-latin{oratio} indicating what a being is (◊original-latin{quid est esse}); therefore an ◊original-latin{oratio} indicating what a being is is composed of names and verbs. But those from which a logical definition is composed are only ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{differentiae}; therefore ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{differentiae} are names and verbs.}
