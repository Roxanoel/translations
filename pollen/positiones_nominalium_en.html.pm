These are our positions concerning universals.
◊items-numbered{
◊item{First, we ◊uncertain{consent} that universals, like ◊original-latin{genera} and ◊original-latin{species}, are names (◊original-latin{nomina}).}
◊item{Second, we posit, against the opinion of the ◊original-latin{reales}, that nothing exists aside from particulars.}
◊item{Third, we disagree with what is proposed by Aristotle in the book on Generation, ◊addition{namely} that ◊uncertain{something can grow (◊original-latin{augmentari})}}
◊item{Fourth, we say, with Zeno, that it does not appear that something ◊addition{can} move, to which Aristotle disagrees at the end of the sixth ◊addition{book} of Physics.}
◊item{We state that there is no action, except via pores (◊original-latin{per poros}).}
◊item{Again, we say, with Zeno, that being is said univocally about those ◊addition{things} which are (◊original-latin{de hiis quae sunt}).}
◊item{Moreover, we say that there are only two universals, namely ◊original-latin{genus} and ◊original-latin{species}.}
