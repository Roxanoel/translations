<root><h2>Positiones Nominalium</h2>
<span>English</span>
<span>CIMAGL 61 (1991), edited by Sten Ebbesen</span>
<span>Vat. lat. 7678: 88rA</span>

<div>These are our positions concerning universals.
<ol><li><p>First, we <span>consent</span> that universals, like <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, are names (<em>nomina</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Second, we posit, against the opinion of the <em>reales</em>, that nothing exists aside from particulars.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, we disagree with what is proposed by Aristotle in the book on Generation, <span>namely</span> that <span>something can grow (<em>augmentari</em>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Fourth, we say, with Zeno, that it does not appear that something <span>can</span> move, to which Aristotle disagrees at the end of the sixth <span>book</span> of Physics.</p></li>
<li><p>We state that there is no action, except via pores (<em>per poros</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we say, with Zeno, that being is said univocally about those <span>things</span> which are (<em>de hiis quae sunt</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, we say that there are only two universals, namely <em>genus</em> and <em>species</em>.</p></li></ol></div></root>
