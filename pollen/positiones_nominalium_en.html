<div>These are our positions concerning universals.
<ol><li><p>First, we <span>consent</span> that universals, like <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, are names (<em>nomina</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Second, we posit, against the opinion of the <em>reales</em>, that nothing exists aside from particulars.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, we disagree with what is proposed by Aristotle in the book on Generation, <span>namely</span> that <span>something can grow (<em>augmentari</em>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Fourth, we say, with Zeno, that it does not appear that something <span>can</span> move, to which Aristotle disagrees at the end of the sixth <span>book</span> of Physics.</p></li>
<li><p>We state that there is no action, except via pores (<em>per poros</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we say, with Zeno, that being is said univocally about those <span>things</span> which are (<em>de hiis quae sunt</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, we say that there are only two universals, namely <em>genus</em> and <em>species</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>and that some accident is in a subject which neither denominates the subject <em>simpliciter</em>, nor according to the "what" (<em>secundum quid</em>);</p></li>
<li><p>and that <span>"accident"</span> contains under itself all universals.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we say that grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric are a single science (<em>unam scientiam</em>), against the division of Al-Farabi;</p></li>
<li><p>besides this we disagree with what Priscian is saying, <span>namely</span> that a syllab cannot <span>be had in a meter at many times (<em>plura tempora</em>), because we posit that a syllab can be had in an infinite time.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Also we disagree with the same <span>(Priscian)</span> and agree with the Stoics, who posited that an interjection has to be included among adverbs.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, we posit that it is insufficient, because he did not teach the species of figures of speech (<em>topoi</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, we posit that no construction is faulty.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, against Aristotle, we say that the book On Interpretation is thoroughly <span>superfluous/overabundant</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>And again that it is <span>diminished</span>, because it did not thoroughly teach the art of dividing,</p></li>
<li><p>and that all science is demonstrative, not topical <span>(of the topics)</span>.</p></li></ol></div></root>
